#### Methodology Diagram

### Directory Info
- The preprocessing folder includes exploratory data analysis, general preprocessing and some experimental advanced preprocessing techniques
- The UNet folder contains model training and a notebook which explains how to use it for inference

#### Model can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/models/aryankashyapnaveen/u-net-lung-segmentation : https://www.kaggle.com/models/aryankashyapnaveen/u-net-lung-segmentation

### We have used the following paper as reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10451633/

## Future work:
- Use the mobile-net backbone.
- Improve performance with advanced preprocessing techniques.
