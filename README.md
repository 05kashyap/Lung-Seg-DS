This project aims to automate the segmentation of lung scans for tumors using the UNet Architecture.

### We have used the following paper as reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10451633/

## Future work:
- Use the mobile-net backbone.
- Improve performance with advanced preprocessing techniques.
